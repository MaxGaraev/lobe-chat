# Deploy GDZ.WORKS with Netlify

If you want to deploy GDZ.WORKS on Netlify, you can follow these steps:

## Deploy GDZ.WORKS with Netlify

<Steps>
  ### Fork the GDZ.WORKS Repository

  Click the Fork button to fork the GDZ.WORKS repository to your GitHub account.

  ### Prepare your OpenAI API Key

  Go to [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to obtain your OpenAI API Key.

  ### Import to Netlify Workspace

  <Callout>
    After testing, it is currently not supported to have a one-click deployment button similar to
    Vercel/Zeabur. The reason is unknown. Therefore, manual import is required.
  </Callout>

  Click "Import from git"

  Then click "Deploy with Github" and authorize Netlify to access your GitHub account.

  Next, select the GDZ.WORKS project:

  ### Configure Site Name and Environment Variables

  In this step, you need to configure your site, including the site name, build command, and publish directory. Fill in your site name in the "Site Name" field. If there are no special requirements, you do not need to modify the remaining configurations as we have already set the default configurations.

  Click the "Add environment variables" button to add site environment variables:

  Taking OpenAI as an example, the environment variables you need to add are as follows:

  | Environment Variable | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                 | Example                                                               |
  | -------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `OPENAI_API_KEY`     | Required | This is the API key you applied for on the OpenAI account page                                                                                                              | `sk-xxxxxx...xxxxxx`                                                  |
  | `ACCESS_CODE`        | Required | Add a password to access this service. You can set a long password to prevent brute force attacks. When this value is separated by commas, it becomes an array of passwords | `awCT74` or `e3@09!` or `code1,code2,code3`                           |
  | `OPENAI_PROXY_URL`   | Optional | If you manually configure the OpenAI interface proxy, you can use this configuration to override the default OpenAI API request base URL                                    | `https://aihubmix.com/v1`, default value: `https://api.openai.com/v1` |

  <Callout type={'tip'}>
    For a complete list of environment variables supported by GDZ.WORKS, please refer to the [ðŸ“˜
    Environment Variables](/docs/self-hosting/environment-variables)
  </Callout>

  Afteradding the variables, finally click "Deploy lobe-chat" to enter the deployment phase

  ### Wait for Deployment to Complete

  After clicking deploy, you will enter the site details page, where you can click the "Deploying your site" in blue or the "Building" in yellow to view the deployment progress.

  Upon entering the deployment details, you will see the following interface, indicating that your GDZ.WORKS is currently being deployed. Simply wait for the deployment to complete.

  During the deployment and build process:

  ### Deployment Successful, Start Using

  If your Deploy Log in the interface looks like the following, it means your GDZ.WORKS has been successfully deployed.

  At this point, you can click on "Open production deploy" to access your GDZ.WORKS site.
</Steps>

## Set up Custom Domain (Optional)

You can use the subdomain provided by Netlify, or choose to bind a custom domain. Currently, the domain provided by Netlify has not been contaminated, and can be accessed directly in most regions.
