# Configure ZITADEL Authentication Service

<Steps>
  ### Create ZITADEL Application

  Log in to the console of your ZITADEL instance using an account with at least a [`Project Owner` role](https://zitadel.com/docs/guides/manage/console/managers#roles), navigate to (or [create](https://zitadel.com/docs/guides/manage/console/projects#create-a-project)) the project you'd like to host your application in, and click the **New** button to create an application.

  Fill in the name, choose **Web** as the application type, and click **Continue**.

  Choose **Code** as the authentication method.

  In the **Redirect URIs** field, fill in:

  ```
  http(s)://your-domain/api/auth/callback/zitadel
  ```

  <Callout type={'important'}>
    - You can fill in or modify redirect URIs after creating the application, but make sure the filled
      URL is consistent with the deployed URL.

    - Replace `http(s)://your-domain` with the actual URL that GDZ.WORKS is deployed to.
  </Callout>

  Confirm the configuration and click **Create**.

  Save the **ClientId** and **ClientSecret** for later use.

  In the application settings page, navigate to the **Token Settings** tab, enable **User Info inside ID Token** option, and click **Save**.

  Navigate to the **URLs** tab, and save the **issuer** URL.
