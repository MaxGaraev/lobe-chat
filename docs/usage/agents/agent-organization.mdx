# Assistant Organization Guide

GDZ.WORKS provides a rich variety of AI assistant resources. Users can easily add various assistants through the assistant market, offering a wide range of application scenarios for AI applications.

When you have added a large number of assistants, finding a specific assistant in the list may become challenging. GDZ.WORKS provides `search`, `grouping`, and `pinning` functions to help you better organize assistants and improve efficiency in locating them.

## Assistant Grouping

Firstly, GDZ.WORKS's AI assistants support organization through grouping. You can categorize assistants of the same type together and easily search for the required assistants by collapsing and expanding groups.

### Assistant Settings

- In the menu of an individual assistant, selecting the `Move to Group` option can quickly categorize the assistant into the specified group.
- If you don't find the group you want, you can choose `Add Group` to quickly create a new group.

### Group Settings

- In the group menu, you can quickly create a new assistant under that group.
- Clicking the `Group Management` button allows you to `rename`, `delete`, `sort`, and perform other operations on all groups.

## Assistant Search

- At the top of the assistant list, you can use the assistant search function to easily locate the assistant you need using keywords.

## Assistant Pinning

- In the assistant menu, you can use the `Pin` function to pin the assistant to the top.
- After pinning an assistant, a pinned area will appear at the top of the assistant list, displaying all pinned assistants.
- For pinned assistants, you can choose `Unpin` to remove them from the pinned area.
