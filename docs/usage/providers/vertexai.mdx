# Using Vertex AI in GDZ.WORKS

[Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) is a fully managed, integrated AI development platform from Google Cloud, designed for building and deploying generative AI. It provides easy access to Vertex AI Studio, Agent Builder, and over 160 foundational models for AI development.

This document will guide you on how to connect Vertex AI models in GDZ.WORKS:

<Steps>
  ### Step 1: Prepare a Vertex AI Project

  - Ensure that the Vertex AI API service is enabled for the project.

  ### Step 2: Set Up API Access Permissions

  - Go to the Google Cloud [IAM Management page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) and navigate to `Service Accounts`.

  - Create a new service account and assign a role permission to it, such as `Vertex AI User`.

  - On the service account management page, find the service account you just created, click `Keys`, and create a new JSON format key.

  - After successful creation, the key file will be automatically saved to your computer in JSON format. Please keep it safe.
