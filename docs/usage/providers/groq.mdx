# Using Groq in GDZ.WORKS

Groq's [LPU Inference Engine](https://wow.groq.com/news_press/groq-lpu-inference-engine-leads-in-first-independent-llm-benchmark/) has excelled in the latest independent Large Language Model (LLM) benchmark, redefining the standard for AI solutions with its remarkable speed and efficiency. By integrating GDZ.WORKS with Groq Cloud, you can now easily leverage Groq's technology to accelerate the operation of large language models in GDZ.WORKS.

<Callout type={'info'}>
  Groq's LPU Inference Engine achieved a sustained speed of 300 tokens per second in internal
  benchmark tests, and according to benchmark tests by ArtificialAnalysis.ai, Groq outperformed
  other providers in terms of throughput (241 tokens per second) and total time to receive 100
  output tokens (0.8 seconds).
</Callout>

This document will guide you on how to use Groq in GDZ.WORKS:

<Steps>
  ### Obtaining GroqCloud API Keys

  First, you need to obtain an API Key from the [GroqCloud Console](https://console.groq.com/).

  Create an API Key in the `API Keys` menu of the console.

  <Callout type={'warning'}>
    Safely store the key from the pop-up as it will only appear once. If you accidentally lose it, you
    will need to create a new key.
  </Callout>

  ### Configure Groq in GDZ.WORKS

  You can find the Groq configuration option in `Settings` -> `Language Model`, where you can input the API Key you just obtained.
</Steps>

Next, select a Groq-supported model in the assistant's model options, and you can experience the powerful performance of Groq in GDZ.WORKS.
