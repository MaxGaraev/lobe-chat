# Using Amazon Bedrock in GDZ.WORKS

Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed foundational model API service that allows users to access models from leading AI companies (such as AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Stability AI) and Amazon's own foundational models.

This document will guide you on how to use Amazon Bedrock in GDZ.WORKS:

<Steps>
  ### Step 1: Grant Access to Amazon Bedrock Models in AWS

  - Access and log in to the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)

  - Search for `bedrock` and enter the `Amazon Bedrock` service

  - Select `Models access` from the left menu

  - Open model access permissions based on your needs

  <Callout type={'info'}>Some models may require additional information from you</Callout>

  ### Step 2: Obtain API Access Keys

  - Continue searching for IAM in the AWS console and enter the IAM service

  - In the `Users` menu, create a new IAM user

  - Enter the user name in the pop-up dialog box

  - Add permissions for this user or join an existing user group to ensure access to Amazon Bedrock

  - Create an access key for the added user

  - Copy and securely store the access key and secret access key, as they will be needed later

  <Callout type={'warning'}>
    Please securely store the keys as they will only be shown once. If you lose them accidentally, you
    will need to create a new access key.
  </Callout>

  ### Step 3: Configure Amazon Bedrock in GDZ.WORKS

  - Access the `Settings` interface in GDZ.WORKS

  - Find the setting for `Amazon Bedrock` under `Language Models` and open it

  - Open Amazon Bedrock and enter the obtained access key and secret access key

  - Choose an Amazon Bedrock model for your assistant to start the conversation

  <Callout type={'warning'}>
    You may incur charges while using the API service, please refer to Amazon Bedrock's pricing
    policy.
  </Callout>
</Steps>

You can now engage in conversations using the models provided by Amazon Bedrock in GDZ.WORKS.
