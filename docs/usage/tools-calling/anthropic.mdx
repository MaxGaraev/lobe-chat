## Claude 3.5 Sonnet

### Simple Instruction Call: Weather Query

Test Instruction: Instruction ①

  <summary>Tools Calling Raw Output:</summary>

  ```yml

### Complex Instruction Call: Literary Map

Test Instruction: Instruction ②

<Video src="https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/assets/28616219/a9a40899-d5f3-4ef2-aa08-922751b05ca6" />

From the above video:

1. Sonnet 3.5 supports Stream Tools Calling and Parallel Tools Calling;
2. In Stream Tools Calling, it is observed that creating long sentences will cause a delay (as seen in the Tools Calling raw output `[chunk 40]` and `[chunk 41]` with a delay of 6s). Therefore, there will be a relatively long waiting time at the beginning stage of Tools Calling.

## Claude 3 Opus

### Simple Instruction Call: Weather Query

Test Instruction: Instruction ①

<Video src="https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/assets/28616219/0e120fa2-8410-4552-a947-5ab7a91d994d" />

From the above video:

1. Claude 3 Opus outputs a `<thinking>` tag at the beginning of Tools Calling, which is not very helpful for users and consumes more tokens;
2. Opus triggers Tools Calling twice, indicating that it does not support Parallel Tools Calling;
3. The raw output of Tools Calling shows that Opus also supports Stream Tools Calling.

### Complex Instruction Call: Literary Map

Test Instruction: Instruction ②

<Video src="https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/assets/28616219/b2dc8cd9-2582-43fe-9121-29c20a1cdc7b" />

From the above video:

1. Combining with simple tasks, Opus will always output a `<thinking>` tag, which significantly impacts the user experience;
2. Opus outputs the prompts field as a string instead of an array, causing an error and preventing the plugin from being called correctly.

## Claude 3 Sonnet

### Simple Instruction Call: Weather Query

Test Instruction: Instruction ①

<Video src="https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/assets/28616219/600becd5-7f12-4a9a-86c7-e5cca0db6b1b" />

From the above video, it can be seen that Claude 3 Sonnet triggers Tools Calling twice, indicating that it does not support Parallel Tools Calling.

### Complex Instruction Call: Literary Map

Test Instruction: Instruction ②

<Video src="https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/assets/28616219/c150aa5f-36bc-40f2-a779-9c4fdcf2cd4c" />

From the above video, it can be seen that Sonnet 3 fails in the complex instruction call. The error is due to prompts being expected as an array but generated as a string.

## Claude 3 Haiku

<Video src="https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/assets/28616219/02b3e872-735a-4928-8245-a90786acea8b" />

From the above video:

1. Claude 3 Haiku triggers Tools Calling twice, indicating that it also does not support Parallel Tools Calling;
2. Haiku does not provide a good response and directly calls the tool;

### Complex Instruction Call: Literary Map

Test Instruction: Instruction ②

<Video src="https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/assets/28616219/d1e3f804-0b89-4b90-9d78-69aee0db1c4d" />

From the above video, it can be seen that Haiku 3 also fails in the complex instruction call. The error is the same as prompts generating a string instead of an array.
