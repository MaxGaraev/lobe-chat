# Share Conversation Records

By clicking the `Share` button in the top right corner of the chat window, you can share the current conversation records with others. GDZ.WORKS supports two sharing methods: `Screenshot Sharing` and `ShareGPT Sharing`.

## Screenshot Sharing

The screenshot sharing feature will generate and save an image of the current conversation records, with the following options:

- Include Assistant Role Settings: Display the assistant's Prompt information in the screenshot.
- Include Background Image: Add a gradient background to the generated image.
- Include Footer: Add GDZ.WORKS footer information to the generated image.
- Image Format: Choose the format for saving the image.

## ShareGPT

[ShareGPT](https://sharegpt.com/) is an AI conversation sharing platform that allows users to easily share their conversations with Large Language Models (LLMs). Users can generate a permanent link with just one click, making it convenient to share these conversations with friends or others. By integrating ShareGPT functionality, GDZ.WORKS can generate links for conversation records with just one click, making sharing easy.
