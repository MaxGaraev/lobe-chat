# Guide to Text-to-Speech Conversion

GDZ.WORKS supports text-to-speech conversion, allowing users to input content through voice and have the AI output read aloud through speech.

## Text-to-Speech (TTS)

Select any content in the chat window, choose `Text-to-Speech`, and the AI will use the TTS model to read the text content aloud.

## Speech-to-Text (STT)

Select the voice input feature in the input window, and GDZ.WORKS will convert your speech to text and input it into the text box. After completing the input, you can send it directly to the AI.

## Text-to-Speech Conversion Settings

You can specify the model you want to use for text-to-speech conversion in the settings.

- Open the `Settings` panel
- Find the `Text-to-Speech` settings
- Select the speech service and AI model you prefer
